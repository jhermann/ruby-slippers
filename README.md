There's no place like home…

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/src/github"
cd "$HOME/src/github"
git clone "git@github.com:jhermann/ruby-slippers.git"
cd "ruby-slippers"
./click-click-click.sh -n
```

And to get about 1GiB of tools & stuff…

```sh
./tinmans-heart.sh all
```

This increases the chances that your scripts and CI jobs work the same
on every machine tremendously.
